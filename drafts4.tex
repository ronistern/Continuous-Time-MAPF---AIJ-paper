% Theory
In our SMT encoding of \mapfr, the theory $T$ defines the agents' motions. 
The propositional skeleton for this theory is based on MDD-SAT. 
The \decidet procedure is basically the conflict detection part of \ccbs (line~\ref{line:findconflicts} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ccbs}), which is based on Definition~\ref{def:ccbs-conflict} and the \inconflict method. 
The constraints added to the propositional skeleton to resolve a detected conflict are the corresponding \ccbs constraints (line~\ref{line:ccbsconstraints} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ccbs}). 

%. The plan validation procedure 
We denote this \mapfr-specific theory, propositional skeleton, and \decidet implementation as $T_{\textit{MAPFR}}$, 
$P_{\textit{MAPFR}}$, 
and $\decidet_{\textit{MAPFR}}$, respectively, and explain them and the overall process in more details below.

%as problem solving in {\em satisfiability modulo theories} (SMT) \cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/NieuwenhuisOT06,DBLP:journals/constraints/BofillPSV12,DBLP:conf/cp/Nieuwenhuis10}. \konstantin{I didn't get how is CCBS and SMT 'similar' from the below paragraph :)}The basic use of SMT divides a satisfiability problem in some complex logic theory $T$ into an abstract propositional part that keeps the Boolean structure of the decision problem and a simplified decision procedure $\mathit{DECIDE_T}$ that decides fragment of $T$ restricted on {\em conjunctive formulae}. A general $T$-formula $\Gamma$ being decided for satisfiability is transformed to a {\em propositional skeleton} by replacing its atoms with propositional variables. The standard SAT-solving procedure then decides what variables should be assigned $\mathit{TRUE}$ in order to satisfy the skeleton - these variables tells what atoms hold in $\Gamma$. $\mathit{DECIDE_T}$ then checks if the conjunction of atoms assigned $\mathit{TRUE}$ is valid with respect to axioms of $T$. If so then satisfying assignment is returned and we are finished. Otherwise a conflict from $\mathit{DECIDE_T}$ (often called a {\em lemma}) is reported back to the SAT solver and the skeleton is extended with new constraints resolving the conflict. In more general cases, not only new constraints are added to resolve a conflict but also new variables i.e. atoms can be added to $\Gamma$.

\subsubsection{Theory for \mapfr}
For a given \mapfr problem $\tuple{\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \source, \target, \coord, \mathcal{A}}$, the corresponding theory is a set of axioms that define agents motions. 
This is captured in $\mathcal{A}$ and the collision detection and conflict detection functions (\iscollision and \inconflict). 
\konstantin{maybe add an example here}\roni{Yes, I think this is needed here. Pavel, can you help?}



\subsubsection{Propositional Skeleton for \mapfr}

%Our propositional skeleton is based on MDD-SAT, which is a state of the art propositional encodings of classical \mapf~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecai/SurynekFSB16}. MDD-SAT defines a Boolean variable $\mathcal{X}_{v}^{t}(a_i)$ for every discrete time step $t$, agent $i$, and vertex $v$ the agent may occupy at time $t$, and a decision variable $\mathcal{E}_{u,v}^{t}(a_i)$ for every time $t$, agent $i$, and edge $(u,v)$ the agent may traverse at time $t$. 
%uses the following decision variables $\mathcal{X}_{v}^{t}(a_i)$ and $\mathcal{E}_{u,v}^{t}(a_i)$ for discrete time-steps $t \in \{0,1,2, ...\}$ describing occurrence of agent $a_i$ in $v$ or the traversal of edge $\{u,v\}$ by $a_i$ at time-step $t$. \mapf movement rules are encoded on top of these variables as simple local constraints.


%This encoding cannot be used directly for \mapfr, since A significant difficulty in MAPF$_R$ is that we need decision variables with respect to continuous time. Fortunately we do not need a variable for any possible time but only for important moments derived from CCBS conflict elimination constraints.

The propositional skeleton is created initially in a way similar to how \ccbs creates its root \ct node. For each agent, we run a single-agent search search algorithm to find the shortest path between that agent's start and goal locations. 
Then, we create a propositional skeleton by defining decision variables for every vertex/edge $v/(u,v)$, agent $i$, and time interval during which the agents visited $v$/ traversed the edge $(u,v)$.

% Describing the MDDR
%\mddr represents a collection of single-agent plans for an individual agent. Specifically, the \mddr for agent $i$ and a set of conflicts $\Psi$ represents all paths generated by CSIPP with respect to all subsets of constraints w.r.t. individual agent.[[Roni: 1. This was said in the pararaph above. 2. It was not clea. ]]
%The MDD we create, however, is different from that MDD. 
%To avoid confusion with the MDD used by ICTS, we refer to our MDD as \mddr.
