As in classical \mapf, we define a single-agent plan for an agent $i$ to be a sequence of actions $\pi_i=(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ 
such that executing it moves agent $i$ from $\source(i)$ to $\target(i)$. 
Let ${\pi_i}_D$ be the duration of the plan, i.e., the sum of the durations of its constituent actions: \begin{equation}
    {\pi_i}_D=\sum_{a\in\pi_i} {a_i}_D
\end{equation}

Let ${\pi_i}_\varphi$ be the motion function that defines where agent $i$ is at any time point throughout the execution of $\pi_i$. This motion function is defined by aggregating the motion function of $\pi_i$'s constituent actions:
\begin{equation}
    {\pi_i}_\varphi(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        {a_1}_\varphi(t)  & t\leq {a_1}_D \\
        {a_2}_\varphi(t-{a_1}_D)  & {a_1}_D<t\leq {a_2}_D \\
        \cdots & \cdots  \\
        {a_j}_\varphi(t-\sum_{l=1}^{j-1}{a_l}_D)  & \sum_{l=1}^{j-1}{a_l}_D)<t\leq \sum_{l=1}^{j}{a_l}_D) \\
        \cdots & \cdots  \\
        {a_n}_\varphi(t-\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{a_j}_D)  & \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{a_j}_D)<t\leq {\pi_i}_D \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}


A \emph{conflict} between two single-agent plans is naturally defined as the case where if they agents execute their respective plans starting at the same time then there exists a point in time for which the \emph{shapes} of the agents overlap. 
To detect this overlap, we assume a \emph{collision-detection} method $\isconflict:\{1,\ldots,k\}\times \{1,\ldots,k\}
\times \mathcal{M}\times \mathcal{M}
\rightarrow \{\true,\false\}$ 
is available where \isconflict($i,j,m_i,m_j$)=$\true$ iff 
when agents $i$ and $j$ occupy locations $m_i$ and $m_j$, respectively, then their shapes overlap. 
%the shapes of agents $i$ and $j$ overlap if $i$ is at $m_i$ and $j$ is at $m_j$ at the same time.

For example, if the agents are disk-shaped with a radius of $r$, then conflict occurs between two single-agent plans if there exists a point in time for which the distance between the coordinates associated with the agents following these plans are less than $2r$ distance apart. 
That is, in this setting, 
\begin{equation}
\isconflict(i,j, m_i,m_j)=
\begin{cases}
\true & ||m_i-m_j||_2\leq 2r \\
\false & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Note that our problem definition and the algorithms we propose later are not restricted to disk-shaped agents and this particular type of \isconflict implementation.
