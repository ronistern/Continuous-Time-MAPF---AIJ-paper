The MDD we create, however, is different from that MDD. 
To avoid confusion with the MDD used by ICTS, we refer to our MDD as \mddr. 
Every node in the \mddr is a timed action $(a,t)$, 
except the root of the \mddr which represents starting the single-agent plan at time zero. 
The children of a node $n=(a,t)$ are generated as follows. 
For every move action $a'\in \mathcal{A}$ 
that starts in $\tov(a)$ and ends before the makespan bound (i.e., $t+a_D+a'_D\leq \mu$)
we create a child node $n'=(a',t')$, 
where $t'=t+a_D$ and $v'=\tov(a)$. 
This child is added to $n$ even if there exists a constraint $Con=\tuple{i, a', [t_i, t_i^u)}$ in $Const(\Psi)$ that prohibits agent $i$ from performing $a'$ at time $t'$, i.e., 
if $t\in[t_i, t_i^u)$. 
To represent the option of satisfying $Con$, we add a new child to $n$ that represents the option of performing a wait action that stays at $v'$ until $a'$ can be performed without conflicting with $Con$. 
That is, we add a new child node $(a'', t')$ to $(a,t)$ where $a''$ is the wait action that stays at $v'$ until time $t_i^u$. The duration of this wait action is simply $t_i^u-t'$. 
If $\Psi$ contains a conflict with this timed wait actions $(a'',t'')$, then we add 
Note that the set of conflicts $(\Psi)$ may contain a conflict that includes the newly added timed action $(a'',t')$. 
Regardless, th
